# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Labyrinth Roguelike

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Labyrinth Choose your own adventure game that has trait based combat, unique encounters, etc.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The game runs by looping through each key of a dictionary, which will run a function, possibly named sequence1, sequence2a, etc.  The actions taken within each sequence function will determine how the branch continues, with certain encounters per branch.  At the beginning of the run the player can pick certain traits, equipment, and skills that will be appended to 3 different lists, which will determine how combat is played during that run.  Based on how many runs more and more things will be unlocked, which will be saved to a text file.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
Not sure

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Multiple branches, not sure how many sections per run, yet to determine, multiple mobs to fight or puzzles, number of runs is kept in external file

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Stats system, more fleshed out combinations

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Completely fleshed out mob encounters, maybe more monsters per encounter, etc.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next step is testing the encounter functions, I have completed the battle functions and at the moment am currently beginning to work on a scenario test.  If the scenario tests work, then I will be mostly done with the actual coding work, I can begin to flesh out the actual text portions of the code, which will be the heaviest section of the content.  After I finish the text portions, I will begin to see how I can implement the run number save system and the extra skills/items that will be unlocked.  If the save function is implemented I can begin to work on point allocated stats at the beginning of the run, which will affect the combat and actions taken in scenarios based on certain stats, ex. Strength affects how high of a roll is needed to land a critical hit on a monster or dexterity affects action rolls within the labyrinth.  Stats should be changed based on certain actions wtihin the run. as well.
