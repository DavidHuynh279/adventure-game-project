# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Choose your own adventure game(Most likely what I will try to do, inventory system, name input, choices appearing based on inventory items/stats),  
Note creator,
Password dictionary (Saves passwords, possibly auto log in),


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Are my ideas ok?
